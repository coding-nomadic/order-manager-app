# OMinitiator


This is an android app for the product OM (Order Managemnet) POC done in the company during hackathon.
This app calls all the endpoints of Rest APIs which are exposed from the springboot-om-app.
This code doest belongs to the company, its just a POC done by me during the hackathon in the company.
